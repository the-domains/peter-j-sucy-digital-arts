Welcome to Peter J. Sucy Digital Arts

Welcome to My Photography Site

Although my latest passion is 3d lenticular imaging, I still travel to photograph. Getting away several times a year to new locations. This past year this included trips to both Maine and Utah. Maine, oft visited over the years as it is my home state. Maine has one of the most diverse landscapes on the east coast, still providing me with new places to explore.  

This October we spent 10 days in Utah. My goal was to visit as many as possible, hoping to scout for places to come back and spend more time. Still, there were images to be made seemingly everywhere I turned. The National Parks we visited included Arches, Bryce, Canyonlands, Capitol Reef, Escalante,  Grand Canyon (North Rim), and Zion, as well as Dixie National Forest, Goblin Hills, & Dead Horse Point State Parks.
